# Stocks-Analysis 2017-2018
## Overview:
The first purpose of this stock analysis to provide overview of each stock's over 2 years of performance, so users make an informed choice of stock investment.
Secondly, we want to refactored our original code to achieve a faster results and understand the adavantages of refactored code.

## Stock Analysis

### In the year of 2017:

This was a great year for investors who invested in the 12 stocks we analyzed. Majority of these stocks yield great returns, except the TERP stock.
SPWR traded the most with the total volume of 782187000 and 23% return.And DQ stock was traded the least amount in volume, but had the highest return rate at 199.4%.
However, in 2018 stock market tell you a very different story than 2017. Most of these stocks yield negative returns. If you invest only based on 2017, you most likely would have a negative return on your investment.

### In the year 2018:

The DQ stock with most return in 2017 resulted in the biggest lost in 2018 at -62.6%. Only 2 stocks, ENPH and RUN, had a consistent returns over the 2 years of time. If you choose to invest in RUN, you would have the biggest return on your investment in 2018.


## Refactored Code:
Second part of this analysis focused on refactoring the original code, hope to achieve a faster run time and make sure we are pulling right stock ticker every time when we run complicated for loops.
Please see the below screenshots of before and after comparison of refactored codes.

Original Code:

2017 Original Code:

It is obvious that refactored code resulted in faster run time.



## Summary:

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

**Advantages**:

- Advantages of refactoring code is to keep it simple and works faster. You can get the results quicker and save memeories on your end.


**Disadvanatges**:

- Too simple code can confuse outsiders or coworkers without given further notes. It also could be difficult to debug if the results doesn't match with what you would expected.

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA scrip:

Cons: when my initial code gave me error messages, I was confused by which part of the code caused the problem.

Pros: The code works faster and saves me time, so I can review my results as soon as possible.
